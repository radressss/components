# custom-components

The boilerplate created by Vite. Can be installed and run by

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Most of the code is in `App.tsx` and in `App.css`.

Components are bit too custom and require individual css classes for each elements. I did not move components to different files for now.

One of the behavior that I did not see was if lists should disappeared if hovered out. So for the clicking one I made it stick and only be closable by close button. For the other one, hovering out of it does close the items.
